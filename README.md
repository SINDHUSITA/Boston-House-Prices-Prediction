# Boston-House-Prices-Prediction
This project aims to predict the House Prices in Boston, Massachusetts given various features describing the house. 
In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.
